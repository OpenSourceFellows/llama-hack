We are creating an AI agent that can followup with smaller nonprofits to increase bandwidth by: 
- Identifying grants that theyâ€™d be great fits for through NLP 
- Drafting potential proposals based on past grantees and pointing out the considerations they should add 
- Creating any followup tasks as an internal project board that sends notification as an sms interface
